# as9

This lab took about 8 hours to complete because first time, I followed the Milestones in my host computer, not in the VM. So, I redid the lab in the VM, but something was wrong, so I deleted it and did it all over again.

I deployed the Ubuntu - Dionaea with HTTP
mhn-honeypot-1

I didn't really ecnounter any issues, besides the installation process, but it is fairly easy instructions to follow, just a lot of patience is needed.

After deploying, I left the machine on about 30 minutes and the result are as follows:
